NOTE : THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I AM WRITTING A README FILE, SO... FORGIVE MY CASUAL LANGUAGE AND OTHER MISTAKES
This is a chatbot made using pyttsx3, speach_recognition in python
It can speak as well as listen... no need to type anything.
To use it on your system , make sure you have python installed with other libs used in this code. They are pyttsx3, speach_recognition, random, webbrrowser, datetime, wikipedia.
If they are not installed, install them using the following commands in cmd
    
    pip install pyttsx3
    pip install SpeechRecognition
    pip install PyAudio (Look on stackoverflow, if reports error)
    pip install wikipedia 
   
Other libs used in the code usually comes preinstalled
After succesfull instalation of these packages , run the code in a python IDE
         
       **** KEY FEATURES ****

NOTE : USE HEADPHONES(WITH MICROPHONE) AND SIT IN A SILENT PLACE WHILE USING THE CHATBOT
There might be some issue while translating your speach to text due to the disturbance in mic or suroundings. Please ignore that.
There are few glitches. The code might crash while using the wikipedia lib due to sound issues
